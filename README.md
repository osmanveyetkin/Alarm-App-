# ⏰ Modern Alarm Clock App (C# Windows Forms)

This project is a **modern alarm clock application** developed using **C# and Windows Forms** with a clean and user-friendly interface.  
It allows users to set an alarm by selecting the hour and minute, and play a selected music file when the alarm time is reached.  
When the alarm goes off, users can choose to **Snooze (delay for 10 minutes)** or **Dismiss (stop the alarm)**.
